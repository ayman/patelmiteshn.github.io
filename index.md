## About Me

I am a Senior Research Scientist at FX Palo Alto Laboratory Inc. (FXPAL) with extensive experience in developing novel systems using machine learning / deep learning in the domain of indoor localization, user behavior modeling, activity recognition, sensor fusion, using variety of sensors such as RF sensors, RGB, RGB-D images, LiDAR as well as big user data harnessed through web. Prior to joining FXPAL, I was a Research Scientist at Yahoo! Labs where I worked in the Ad Science team on user behavior modeling problem based on user-app interaction data logged on different Yahoo properties. I received my Ph.D. in Robotics from University of Technology Sydney in 2014 where I focused on modeling a wide spectrum of high-level user activities (also known as activities of daily living) using different probabilistic techniques.
